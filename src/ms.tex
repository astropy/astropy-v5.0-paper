\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\secauthor{Adrian Price-Whelan}

The \python programming language is a high-level, interpreted (as opposed to
compiled) programming language that has become an industry standard across many
computational domains, technological sectors, and fields of research.
Despite claims to the contrary \citep{Portegies-Zwart:2020}, \python enables
scalable, time- and energy-efficient code execution \citep[e.g.,][]{Augier:2021}
with a focus on code readability, ease of use, and interoperability with other
languages.
Over the last decade, \python has grown enormously in popularity to become a
dominant programming language in the astronomical and broader scientific
communities.
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:python-mentions} shows the number of yearly
full-text mentions of \python as compared to a few other programming languages
in refereed articles in the astronomical literature, demonstrating its nearly
exponential growth in popularity.
The rapid adoption of \python by astronomy researchers, students, observatories,
and technical staff combined with an associated increase in awareness and
interest about open-source software tools is contributing to a paradigm shift in
the way research is done, data is analyzed, and results are shared in astronomy
and beyond.

One of the factors that has led to its rapid ascent in popularity in scientific
contexts has been the significant, volunteer-driven effort behind developing
community-oriented open-source software tools and fostering communities of users
and developers that have grown around these efforts.
Today, a broad and feature-diverse ``ecosystem'' of packages exists in the
\python scientific computing landscape: Roughly ordered from general-use to
domain-specific, this landscape now includes packages that provide core
numerical analysis functionality like \package{numpy} \citep{numpy:nature} and
\package{scipy} \citep{scipy}, visualization frameworks like
\package{matplotlib} \citep{matplotlib}, machine learning and data analysis
packages like \package{tensorflow} \citep{tensorflow}, \package{pymc3}
\citep{Salvatier:2016}, and \package{emcee} \citep{emcee}, domain-specific
libraries like \package{yt} \citep{yt:2011}, \package{plasmapy}
\citep{plasmapy}, \package{sunpy} \citep{sunpy:apj}, \package{Biopython}
\citep{biopython}, and \package{sympy} \citep{sympy} (to name a few in each
category).
The \astropypkg \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018} core package began in this
vein, as an effort to consolidate the development of commonly-used functionality
needed to perform astronomical research into a community-developed \python
package.

The \astropypkg core package was one of the first large, open-source \python
packages developed for astronomy and provides, among other things, software
functionality for reading and writing astronomy-specific data formats (e.g.,
FITS), transforming and representing astronomical coordinates, and representing
and propagating physical units in code.
An early description of the core functionality in \astropypkg can be found in
the first Astropy paper \citep{astropy:2013} or in detail in the core package
documentation.\footnote{\url{https://docs.astropy.org/}}
The \astropypkg core package is now largely stable in that the software
interface does not change without sufficient and significant motivation, and the
addition of new features into the core package has slowed significantly as
compared to the first years of its development.
This is largely driven by the fact that the core package now represents just one
piece of the broader astronomy \python context, and much new feature development
is now happening in more specialized packages that are expanding the
capabilities of the Astropy ecosystem by building on top of the foundations laid
by the \astropypkg core package.
Because of this natural expansion, the name Astropy has grown in scope beyond a
single \python library to become ``the Astropy Project.''

The Astropy Project is a community effort that represents the union of the
\astropypkg core package, the ecosystem of astronomy-specific software tools
that are interoperable with \astropypkg (Astropy Affiliated Packages),
\emph{and} the community of users, developers, and maintainers that participate
in Astropy efforts.
However, there is no institution responsible for managing the Astropy Project,
for funding or maintaining its development, or sustaining it into the future:
The Project is maintained and coordinated largely by volunteers.
While new Astropy-affiliated packages are being developed that expand upon the
core functionality in the \astropypkg package, representing a natural expansion
of the Astropy Project ecosystem, the needs of and challenges faced by the
Project are evolving.
In particular, the transition from focusing our energy on development and
maintenance of a single core package, to instead sustaining the core package and
fostering the development of the community and its expansion has been a key
issue faced by the Astropy Project in the last several years.

In this Article, we briefly describe recent key updates in the \astropypkg core
package since the last Astropy paper (``Paper II''; \citealt{astropy:2018}),
major updates in the governance, contributor base, and funding of the Project,
and discuss some of the future plans and challenges faced by the Astropy
Project.

\section{Major Updates in the Astropy Project} \label{sec:project-updates}

\subsection{Project governance} \label{sec:project-governance}

\secauthor{Erik Tollerud}

%Briefly summarize new procedures and governance structure, new CoCo, election
%process overview, etc.

As part of the process of developing Astropy into a long-term sustainable
product, and to improve transparency and accountability, the Project agreed to
write down and formalize our governance structure (partly supported by explicit
funding for this purpose - see \S \ref{sec:project-funding}). At the 2019
coordination meeting input was gathered from participants on what governance
structures existed in the associated Open Source Software communities, and what
would fit well with the needs of Astropy. This led into a ``retreat'' planned
for March 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, this became a serious of
virtual meetings of the ``Astropy Governance Working Group''.  This group
drafted the APE0 document \citep{ape0}, which was then eventually ratified and
implemented by the ``Astropy Governance Implementation Working Group'' in Fall
2021. While the process emphasized flexibility and the ability to adapt to
changing circumstances, it is expected that this is the framework Astropy's
governance will operate in for at least the medium-term future.

The APE0 \citep{ape0} document lays out the principles of this governance
structure, so we refer the reader to that document for a more thorough
description.  However here we highlight some key elements. While many of these
principles were already de facto true or have been discussed organically (and
have been discussed in earlier papers in this series), the APE0-based governance
aimed to provide a single place where the community can agree as a starting
point. With this in mind, it highlights the developer and user community of the
Astropy Project as the ultimate sources of authority, as well as the core
principle of ``do-ocracy'' that those who do work for the Project (be it coding,
training, or other less concrete contributions) gain more influence on the
outputs of the Project by virtue of their effort.  APE0 adds, however, the
concept of ``voting members'' - a self-governed part of that community who are
entrusted to elect the Coordination Committee. While this committee has existed
from the inception of the project, APE0 establishes a formal voting process for
this committee, and explicitly outlines the rights and responsibilities of the
Coordination Committee. This role is mainly to facilitate consensus and act as
the decision maker when other mechanisms have failed.  However, it also includes
powers that either require central authority or secrets (e.g. passwords), but
AOE0 also charges the Committee to devolve responsibilities and seek community
input on these items as often as possible.

The first coordinating committee election under these rules took place in fall
2021, electing a mix of prior existing and new coordination committee members,
and was contested in the sense of more candidates than available slots. This
suggests the process is already working to serve the long-term interests of the
committee to both spread the coordination effort, and to ensure it is not
dominated by the same people for as long as the Project continues. While other,
more fine-grained governance improvements are planned for the future, it is
clear the foundation is now in place.

We would like to thank the members of the community that have contributed to
\astropy, that have opened issues and provided feedback, and have supported the
project in a number of different ways.

The \astropy community is supported by and makes use
of a number of organizations and services outside the traditional
academic community. We thank Google for financing and organizing the
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, that has funded severals
students per year to work on \astropy related projects over the
summer. These students often turn into long-term contributors. We also
thank NumFOCUS and the Python Software Foundation for financial
support. Within the academic community, we thank
institutions that make it possible that astronomers and other developers on
their staff can contribute their time to the development of
\astropy projects.  We would like acknowledge the support of the
Space Telescope Science Institute, Harvard--Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
and the South African Astronomical Observatory.

Furthermore, the \astropy packages would not exist in their current form without
a number of web services for code hosting, continuous integration, and
documentation; in particular, \astropy heavily relies on GitHub, Travis CI,
Appveyor, CircleCI, and Read the Docs.

\astropypkg interfaces with the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. It also makes use of the ERFA library \citep{erfa}, which in turn
derives from the IAU SOFA Collection\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org}}
developed by the International Astronomical Union Standards of Fundamental
Astronomy \citep{sofa}.
