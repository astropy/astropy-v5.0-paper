\begin{abstract}
The \astropy Project supports and fosters the development of open-source and openly-developed
\python packages that provide commonly-needed functionality to the astronomical
community.
A key element of the \astropy Project is the core package \astropypkg, which serves as the
foundation for more specialized projects and packages.
In this article, we summarize key features in the core package as of the recent major
release, version 5.0, and provide major updates for the project.
We then discuss supporting a broader ecosystem of inter-operable packages,
including connections with several astronomical observatories and missions.
We also revisit the future outlook of the \astropy Project and the current
status of Learn Astropy. 
We conclude by raising and discussing the current and future challenges facing the project.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\secauthor{Adrian Price-Whelan}

The \python programming language is a high-level, interpreted (as opposed to
compiled) programming language that has become an industry standard across many
computational domains, technological sectors, and fields of research.
Despite claims to the contrary \citep{Portegies-Zwart:2020}, \python enables
scalable, time- and energy-efficient code execution \citep[e.g.,][]{Augier:2021}
with a focus on code readability, ease of use, and interoperability with other
languages.
Over the last decade, \python has grown enormously in popularity to become a
dominant programming language in the astronomical and broader scientific
communities.
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:python-mentions} shows the number of yearly
full-text mentions of \python as compared to a few other programming languages
in refereed articles in the astronomical literature, demonstrating its nearly
exponential growth in popularity.
The rapid adoption of \python by astronomy researchers, students, observatories,
and technical staff combined with an associated increase in awareness and
interest about open-source software tools is contributing to a paradigm shift in
the way research is done, data is analyzed, and results are shared in astronomy
and beyond.

One of the factors that has led to its rapid ascent in popularity in scientific
contexts has been the significant, volunteer-driven effort behind developing
community-oriented open-source software tools and fostering communities of users
and developers that have grown around these efforts.
Today, a broad and feature-diverse ``ecosystem'' of packages exists in the
\python scientific computing landscape: Roughly ordered from general-use to
domain-specific, this landscape now includes packages that provide core
numerical analysis functionality like \package{numpy} \citep{numpy:nature} and
\package{scipy} \citep{scipy}, visualization frameworks like
\package{matplotlib} \citep{matplotlib}, machine learning and data analysis
packages like \package{tensorflow} \citep{tensorflow}, \package{pymc3}
\citep{Salvatier:2016}, and \package{emcee} \citep{emcee}, domain-specific
libraries like \package{yt} \citep{yt:2011}, \package{plasmapy}
\citep{plasmapy}, \package{sunpy} \citep{sunpy:apj}, \package{Biopython}
\citep{biopython}, and \package{sympy} \citep{sympy} (to name a few in each
category).
The \astropypkg \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018} core package began in this
vein, as an effort to consolidate the development of commonly-used functionality
needed to perform astronomical research into a community-developed \python
package.

The \astropypkg core package was one of the first large, open-source \python
packages developed for astronomy and provides, among other things, software
functionality for reading and writing astronomy-specific data formats (e.g.,
FITS), transforming and representing astronomical coordinates, and representing
and propagating physical units in code.
An early description of the core functionality in \astropypkg can be found in
the first Astropy paper \citep{astropy:2013} or in detail in the core package
documentation.\footnote{\url{https://docs.astropy.org/}}
The \astropypkg core package is now largely stable in that the software
interface does not change without sufficient and significant motivation, and the
addition of new features into the core package has slowed significantly as
compared to the first years of its development.
This is largely driven by the fact that the core package now represents just one
piece of the broader astronomy \python context, and much new feature development
is now happening in more specialized packages that are expanding the
capabilities of the Astropy ecosystem by building on top of the foundations laid
by the \astropypkg core package.
Because of this natural expansion, the name Astropy has grown in scope beyond a
single \python library to become ``the Astropy Project.''

The Astropy Project is a community effort that represents the union of the
\astropypkg core package, the ecosystem of astronomy-specific software tools
that are interoperable with \astropypkg (Astropy Affiliated Packages),
\emph{and} the community of users, developers, and maintainers that participate
in Astropy efforts.
However, there is no institution responsible for managing the Astropy Project,
for funding or maintaining its development, or sustaining it into the future:
The Project is maintained and coordinated largely by volunteers.
While new Astropy-affiliated packages are being developed that expand upon the
core functionality in the \astropypkg package, representing a natural expansion
of the Astropy Project ecosystem, the needs of and challenges faced by the
Project are evolving.
In particular, the transition from focusing our energy on development and
maintenance of a single core package, to instead sustaining the core package and
fostering the development of the community and its expansion has been a key
issue faced by the Astropy Project in the last several years.

In this Article, we briefly describe recent key updates in the \astropypkg core
package since the last Astropy paper (``Paper II''; \citealt{astropy:2018}),
major updates in the governance, contributor base, and funding of the Project,
and discuss some of the future plans and challenges faced by the Astropy
Project.

\section{Learn Astropy} \label{sec:learn}

\secauthor{Lía Corrales, David Shupe + Learn team}

\subsubsection{Current status and scope}

{\it Learn Astropy} is an umbrella term that acknowledges the broad educational efforts made by the Astropy Project, which are led by the Astropy Learn Team. 
As described in \textsl{[Astropy-ii paper]}, Learn Astropy content has been categorized along four axes: documentation, which is contained within the python code base; tutorials, consisting of Jupyter Notebook lessons that are published in HTML format online; guides, which are a series of lessons providing a foundational resource for performing a certain type of astronomical analyses; and examples, which are snippets of code that showcase a short task that can be performed with Astropy or its affiliated package. 
These categories continue to drive both the infrastructure choices and the appearance of the Learn Astropy website. Additionally, the Astropy Learn Team has expanded its efforts
in user engagement and in conducting workshops. The Learn team meets
weekly to drive these issues forward.

\begin{itemize}

\item {\bf Learn Astropy website:} The site has a new search interface powered by
Algolia which is used by major shopping sites. This work has been
supported in part by the Dunlap grant. Tutorials have been added and
a {\it ccdproc} Jupyter book has been completed.

\item {\bf User forums:} The Astropy Project has historically maintained a number of avenues for users to seek help or gain access to the developer community. This includes the Astropy mailing list, the Python in Astronomy Facebook group, and the Astropy Slack workspace. The Moore Foundation grant allows this Slack space to
be on a paid plan; additionally NumFOCUS has negotiated a special rate for
open-source projets. While the Slack and Astropy-dev mailing lists are primarily used to discuss the project direction and updates, it was noted that the use of a Facebook community could present a barrier to open source. The Astropy Project identified a need for a public, archived, searchable, and easily-to-navigate interface for users to ask for help Accordingly, we have commissioned 
a Discourse site which is more open than the Facebook group and more user-oriented
than Astropy Slack. A benefit of the Moore Foundation grant is that Astropy
developers are able to invoice as independent contractors the time they
spend helping users on these forums.

\item {\bf Workshops:} the Project has been conducting workshops at winter meetings
of the American Astronomical Society since AAS 225 in January 2015. Up to the
start of the coronavirus pandemic, these were full-day in-person workshops with
as many as 90 participants and a dozen facilitators from the project. During the
pandemic, these workshops were moved to an online format and split into
basic and advanced sessions. Additionally, beginning with the AAS 238 online
meeting, the workshops have been expanded to Summer AAS meetings. The Learn
team finds that the workshop audience is best found as AAS meetings as opposed
to more general Python meetings.

The Astropy Project provided another mode of community engagement at AAS Meetings 235 and 237 by organizing a NumFOCUS Sponsored Projects booth in the AAS Exhibit Hall. Funding for the exhibit hall was provided alternately by NumFOCUS and later by the Moore Foundation funding (\textbf{check this}). The booth hosted a series of Q\&A special sessions during AAS 235 and webinars during the virtual AAS 237 meetings, to provide the general astronomy community information and access to experts on a variety of open source astronomical tools.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Learn vision for the future}

The Learn plan going forward is to continue to improve the tutorial website;
to index third-party tutorials; to promote user engagement on the Discourse
site; and to look for supportable opportunities to expand the reach of
Astropy workshops beyond the American Astronomical Society meetings.



\subsection{Current and Future Challenges}

\begin{itemize}
\item Attracting new contributors when the code has become quite complex,
\item Contributor to maintainer mentoring,
\item Long-term / sustained funding for maintaining infrastructure,
\item ...
\end{itemize}


\begin{acknowledgments}

We would like to thank the members of the community that have contributed to
\astropy, that have opened issues and provided feedback, and have supported the
project in a number of different ways.

The \astropy community is supported by and makes use
of a number of organizations and services outside the traditional
academic community. We thank Google for financing and organizing the
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, that has funded severals
students per year to work on \astropy related projects over the
summer. These students often turn into long-term contributors. We also
thank NumFOCUS and the Python Software Foundation for financial
support. Within the academic community, we thank
institutions that make it possible that astronomers and other developers on
their staff can contribute their time to the development of
\astropy projects.  We would like acknowledge the support of the
Space Telescope Science Institute, Harvard--Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
and the South African Astronomical Observatory.

Furthermore, the \astropy packages would not exist in their current form without
a number of web services for code hosting, continuous integration, and
documentation; in particular, \astropy heavily relies on GitHub, Travis CI,
Appveyor, CircleCI, and Read the Docs.

\astropypkg interfaces with the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. It also makes use of the ERFA library \citep{erfa}, which in turn
derives from the IAU SOFA Collection\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org}}
developed by the International Astronomical Union Standards of Fundamental
Astronomy \citep{sofa}.
