\begin{abstract}
The \astropy Project supports and fosters the development of open-source and openly-developed
\python packages that provide commonly-needed functionality to the astronomical
community.
A key element of the \astropy Project is the core package \astropypkg, which serves as the
foundation for more specialized projects and packages.
In this article, we summarize key features in the core package as of the recent major
release, version 5.0, and provide major updates for the project.
We then discuss supporting a broader ecosystem of inter-operable packages,
including connections with several astronomical observatories and missions.
We also revisit the future outlook of the \astropy Project and the current
status of Learn Astropy. 
We conclude by raising and discussing the current and future challenges facing the project.

\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}

\secauthor{Adrian Price-Whelan}

The \python programming language is a high-level, interpreted (as opposed to
compiled) programming language that has become an industry standard across many
computational domains, technological sectors, and fields of research.
Despite claims to the contrary \citep{Portegies-Zwart:2020}, \python enables
scalable, time- and energy-efficient code execution \citep[e.g.,][]{Augier:2021}
with a focus on code readability, ease of use, and interoperability with other
languages.
Over the last decade, \python has grown enormously in popularity to become a
dominant programming language in the astronomical and broader scientific
communities.
For example, Figure~\ref{fig:python-mentions} shows the number of yearly
full-text mentions of \python as compared to a few other programming languages
in refereed articles in the astronomical literature, demonstrating its nearly
exponential growth in popularity.
The rapid adoption of \python by astronomy researchers, students, observatories,
and technical staff combined with an associated increase in awareness and
interest about open-source software tools is contributing to a paradigm shift in
the way research is done, data is analyzed, and results are shared in astronomy
and beyond.

One of the factors that has led to its rapid ascent in popularity in scientific
contexts has been the significant, volunteer-driven effort behind developing
community-oriented open-source software tools and fostering communities of users
and developers that have grown around these efforts.
Today, a broad and feature-diverse ``ecosystem'' of packages exists in the
\python scientific computing landscape: Roughly ordered from general-use to
domain-specific, this landscape now includes packages that provide core
numerical analysis functionality like \package{numpy} \citep{numpy:nature} and
\package{scipy} \citep{scipy}, visualization frameworks like
\package{matplotlib} \citep{matplotlib}, machine learning and data analysis
packages like \package{tensorflow} \citep{tensorflow}, \package{pymc3}
\citep{Salvatier:2016}, and \package{emcee} \citep{emcee}, domain-specific
libraries like \package{yt} \citep{yt:2011}, \package{plasmapy}
\citep{plasmapy}, \package{sunpy} \citep{sunpy:apj}, \package{Biopython}
\citep{biopython}, and \package{sympy} \citep{sympy} (to name a few in each
category).
The \astropypkg \citep{astropy:2013, astropy:2018} core package began in this
vein, as an effort to consolidate the development of commonly-used functionality
needed to perform astronomical research into a community-developed \python
package.

The \astropypkg core package was one of the first large, open-source \python
packages developed for astronomy and provides, among other things, software
functionality for reading and writing astronomy-specific data formats (e.g.,
FITS), transforming and representing astronomical coordinates, and representing
and propagating physical units in code.
An early description of the core functionality in \astropypkg can be found in
the first Astropy paper \citep{astropy:2013} or in detail in the core package
documentation.\footnote{\url{https://docs.astropy.org/}}
The \astropypkg core package is now largely stable in that the software
interface does not change without sufficient and significant motivation, and the
addition of new features into the core package has slowed significantly as
compared to the first years of its development.
This is largely driven by the fact that the core package now represents just one
piece of the broader astronomy \python context, and much new feature development
is now happening in more specialized packages that are expanding the
capabilities of the Astropy ecosystem by building on top of the foundations laid
by the \astropypkg core package.
Because of this natural expansion, the name Astropy has grown in scope beyond a
single \python library to become ``the Astropy Project.''

The Astropy Project is a community effort that represents the union of the
\astropypkg core package, the ecosystem of astronomy-specific software tools
that are interoperable with \astropypkg (Astropy Affiliated Packages),
\emph{and} the community of users, developers, and maintainers that participate
in Astropy efforts.
However, there is no institution responsible for managing the Astropy Project,
for funding or maintaining its development, or sustaining it into the future:
The Project is maintained and coordinated largely by volunteers.
While new Astropy-affiliated packages are being developed that expand upon the
core functionality in the \astropypkg package, representing a natural expansion
of the Astropy Project ecosystem, the needs of and challenges faced by the
Project are evolving.
In particular, the transition from focusing our energy on development and
maintenance of a single core package, to instead sustaining the core package and
fostering the development of the community and its expansion has been a key
issue faced by the Astropy Project in the last several years.

In this Article, we briefly describe recent key updates in the \astropypkg core
package since the last Astropy paper (``Paper II''; \citealt{astropy:2018}),
major updates in the governance, contributor base, and funding of the Project,
and discuss some of the future plans and challenges faced by the Astropy
Project.

\section{Future Plans for the Astropy Project} \label{sec:future}

\subsection{Roadmap}

\secauthor{Clara Brasseur}


The Astropy Roadmap is a document in the astropy-project repository that captures high level actionable items that the Astropy project aims to undertake to improve the health and stability of the  project. It is a static document that is revisited regularly at the Astropy coordination meetings, to keep track of progress and write new versions as needed. There is a related project board linked to the Roadmap document, that holds specific issues and efforts related to Roadmap items. The project board is a living document that is continually updated as work is planned, assigned, and completed.

All items in the Roadmap have been agreed to be priorities for the Astropy Project, and are color-coded based on resources (both time/effort and developers/expertise) needed to complete the item. Green items are well underway, have sufficient resources/support and a plan in place for completion. Orange items are well defined, and work for aquiring sufficient resources underway. Red items do not yet have a plan for implementation and need more resources. 

The Astropy Roadmap originates from the March 2021 Astropy Coordination meeting where it was first drafted before being handed off to a newly formed Astropy Roadmap working group for completion. The Roadmap in its currant form was adopted via pull request in December 2021.

\begin{acknowledgments}

We would like to thank the members of the community that have contributed to
\astropy, that have opened issues and provided feedback, and have supported the
project in a number of different ways.

The \astropy community is supported by and makes use
of a number of organizations and services outside the traditional
academic community. We thank Google for financing and organizing the
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, that has funded severals
students per year to work on \astropy related projects over the
summer. These students often turn into long-term contributors. We also
thank NumFOCUS and the Python Software Foundation for financial
support. Within the academic community, we thank
institutions that make it possible that astronomers and other developers on
their staff can contribute their time to the development of
\astropy projects.  We would like acknowledge the support of the
Space Telescope Science Institute, Harvard--Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
and the South African Astronomical Observatory.

Furthermore, the \astropy packages would not exist in their current form without
a number of web services for code hosting, continuous integration, and
documentation; in particular, \astropy heavily relies on GitHub, Travis CI,
Appveyor, CircleCI, and Read the Docs.

\astropypkg interfaces with the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. It also makes use of the ERFA library \citep{erfa}, which in turn
derives from the IAU SOFA Collection\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org}}
developed by the International Astronomical Union Standards of Fundamental
Astronomy \citep{sofa}.
