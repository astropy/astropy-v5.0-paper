If you would like to be a co-author, please complete the [Google form
here](https://forms.gle/M93XBNaGbPqoncuE8). If the above does not apply to you
but you feel that you should still be considered for co-authorship, please
complete the form and your application will be reviewed.

The author order will be 'The Astropy Collaboration' as the first author,
followed by people who have contributed significantly to the paper, in order of
contribution level (or alphabetically where contribution levels are similar),
and all other authors will then be listed alphabetically. A note will be
included to indicate the author list and how it was determined.

Building the paper locally
--------------------------

This paper and project uses
[showyourwork](https://github.com/rodluger/showyourwork/) to build the article.
This is a new tool that aims to improve the reproducibility of scientific
articles. Under the hood, this ultimately uses Latex to generate the rendered
PDF, but also uses [Snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/) to enable
constructing a pipeline of dependencies that generate build components (e.g.,
figures, tables, datasets, etc.) automatically during the paper build process.
Importantly, **this means that you can not simply change directory into the src
path and use `pdflatex` to build the paper**. To build the PDF of the article,
you need to use the `Makefile` at the repository root. Building locally required
having `anaconda`, `snakemake`, and a Latex installation on your machine.

To generate the figures, you also need to have some environment variables set.
You must have a local clone of the `astropy/astropy` repository and set the env
variable `ASTROPY_REPO_PATH` to the path of the cloned repository (required).
You also should generate an ADS developer key and set the env variable
`ADS_DEV_KEY` to this key (optional).

With these, in the repository root, run:

```
make
```

This *should* automatically install all of the required dependencies into a
`conda` environment and build the paper with this environment. If this fails for
you, please open an issue.
